<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If that start date is incorrect</h2>
<p>Contact your appropriate body and ask them to update the TRA records with the correct date. This should be the date their induction training formally began, which may be different to their contract start date.</p>
<p>Your appropriate body should let us know when the update has been made so that we can run our eligibility checks again.</p>
