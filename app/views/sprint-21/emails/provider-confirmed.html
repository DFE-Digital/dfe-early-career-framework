<div class="pseudo-email-template">
<p>Dear [name],</p>
<p>[Delivery partner name], with [lead provider name] has confirmed your school.</p>
<p>This means your early career teachers starting in 2021, will receive their 2 year induction programme, based on the Early Career Framework (ECF).</p>

<p><strong>Whatâ€™s next?</strong></p>
<p>We will let you know when you can add your early career teachers and mentors. This is to verify that:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>they have Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)</li>
  <li>they are eligible to do an induction or act as a mentor</li>
</ul>
<p>This will also ensure that your training provider receives funding from the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

<p><strong>What to do if this is not correct</strong></p>
<p>If you have not confirmed an agreement with this training provider or you have confirmed with someone else, report this now:</p>
<p><a href="../schools/report/incorrect-signup">https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk//users/confirm_sign_in?login_token=22345678as9fijhgt</a>.</p>
<p>This link will expire on [expiry date]</p>
