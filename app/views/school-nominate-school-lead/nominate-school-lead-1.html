<p>[school name],</p>

<p>From September 2021 statutory induction is changing. Schools must offer their new early career teachers (ECTs) a 2 year induction programme.</p>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has provided:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>statutory guidance so that schools know their roles and responsibilities</li>
  <li>
    guidance on the 3 programmes that are compliant with the new regulations:

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>an approved training provider leads the programme</li>
      <li>the school delivers the programme using DfE accredited materials</li>
      <li>schools design and deliver their own programme based on the early career framework (ECF)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Schools need to read our guidance and choose an approach that works for them:</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What schools can do next</h2>
<p>We have launched an online service to help schools manage their new programme.</p>
<p>When your school has decided on an approach, nominate someone who manages statutory inductions at your school:</p>
