	<div class="pseudo-email-template">
		<p>Hello,</p>

		<p>The Department for Education (DfE) needs some important information from ((school name)) as soon as possible. </p>
		<p>You need to tell us if you do or do not expect to have any early career teachers (also known as NQTs) joining you in 2021.</p>
		<div class="govuk-inset-text">
		<p>Use this link to tell us now: <br><a class="govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="../schools/expect-early-career-teachers?school-status=not-signed-up">https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/nominations/start?token=22345678as9fijhgt</a></p>		
		</div>
		<p>(Do not share this link. It will only work for your school).</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>		
		<p>If you answer ‘yes’ or you do not know - you’ll be asked to nominate someone at your school to set up your statutory induction programme. We’ll let them know how to do this.</p>
		<p>If you answer ‘no’ - you will not receive any more messages about statutory inductions for early career teachers until the next academic year.</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we need this information now</h2>	
		<p>From September 2021, statutory induction is changing. The ‘NQT year’ will become a 2-year induction programme for early career teachers (ECTs).</p>
		<p>We’ve created an online service to help you access the support offered by the DfE and set up your programme. </p>
		<p>If you have ECTs joining you in 2021, you need to nominate someone to access the service and get your programme set up as soon as possible.</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to get more guidance</h2>
